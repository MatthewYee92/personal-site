#### Intro
I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer at [Hack Reactor @ Galvanize](https://hackreactor.com), where I work on the engineering instruction and curriculum. I also work remotely as a Full-Stack Software Engineer for [Florida Disaster Rescue] and build tools that link people in need to helpful services within their local area. My primary job functions are as a software engineer and software engineer resident instructor.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Seattle, WA.

#### Currently
At Hack Reactor @ Galvanize, I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with students, teach software engineering concepts, and build on-line testing suites. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications.

#### Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1995 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- We subscribed to AOL in 1997. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.

- All of this sounds normal, well at least to me. Here is something about me that you should know. I have what you could call high functioning autism. Growing up my family and I were told that I may never have a 'normal' life from simple conversations, friendships, relationships, and eventually a career once I became an adult. I am proud to say that if you had just met me, you would experience a more than normal conversation,I have many friends, I even have a fiance, and I do have a job! How does this relate to programming? Growing up it was difficult to find work that I was interested in. When I was in high school I was introduced to programming and we were off to the races! I was able to 'hyper-focus' when I was coding, which helped me learn and complete work in a timely manner for the first time. I started learning C++ and would build simple RPG text based games - very simple but I was excited about my work! I would eventually get an A.S from [Eastern Florida State College](https://easternflorida.edu) in Computer Science, leading towards my enrollment in [Hack Reactor & Galvanize](https://hackreactor.com) Software Engineering coding bootcamp. My dad used to say that the greatest feeling in the world was hitting a baseball 'square'. I can only equivalate that feeling when I am solving a coding challenge or I am given a problem to solve, or project to build. When I finish the work - that is my greatest feeling. I truly am lucky to do what I love for a living. I love to build, and solve complex puzzles, I am often told at home to 'turn my brain off and take a break'. I always laugh at that comment because when I am not coding you can find me solving puzzles at home, or adding to my growing rubrics cube collection. To summarize, coding has helped me pivot my life in many ways and I hope you enjoy scrolling through my work!

#### Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Monterey, California. I was a military brat and have had the pleasure of living across the globe. Check out everywhere that I have visited or lived under the stats tab above, and click on countries visited to view an interactive map!


#### Fun facts

- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating matching bow ties for cats and humans.
- I almost always have a sketchbook with me.
- I can't locate every country on a map.
- I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just a resume.

#### I dream of

- always finding inspiration.
- enabling a brighter future.
- doing better.
- no one checking my commit history for early drafts of this file, or in general.
